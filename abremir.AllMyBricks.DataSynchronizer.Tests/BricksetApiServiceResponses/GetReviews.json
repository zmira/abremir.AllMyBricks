While this set would certainly look good on a professional's desk, they come at a price only a professional can afford. This is not terribly complicated in design and can be built for less than $5.00 from the Pick-A-Brick wall from the picture on the front of the box. Buy a whole cup for $15.00 and you can make about half a dozen. If the additional cost was supporting a foundation for historic preservation or to feed children, I could see spending this for a \"unique\" piece of architecture and history. Unfortunately, I can own this for less ordering the parts from the LEGO online PAB. And no, the engraved \"Sears Tower\" doesn't make it worth $20.00. Save your money and make your own from the PAB wall.

I enjoyed the number of tiles for my collection and I also enjoyed the general appeal to this set. It really is something that you can display on a mantel or coffee table and have it fit nicely with almost every sort of room decor.\n                It is sadly a bit expensive for my tastes given the number of pieces, but is made up by the number of tiles, look, and informative booklet. Lego did a great job when creating the Architecture set in general.\n                A good buy if you're wanting to get into the architecture scene.\n        ","Html":true},{"$type":"1","Author":"kaans","DatePosted":"2013-08-16T21:17:31Z","OverallRating":5,"Parts":5,"BuildingExperience":5,"Playability":4,"ValueForMoney":5,"Title":"Only con: base","Review":"\n            I really love Architecture sets, especially the small ones, It's fun to read about the building/monument and then build it\n            The only con with this set, and other towers, except the Dubai one, is the base wobles, the 2 pieces of the base plate doesn't stay on one plane, a minor con, really fun build\n        ","Html":true}]
