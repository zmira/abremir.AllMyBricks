            Disappointing cost per piece and costly for its design
        </title>
        <review>
            When these were first announced I was excited at having some sets that would sit on a professional's desk and look at home. While this set would certainly look good on a professional's desk, they come at a price only a professional can afford. This is not terribly complicated in design and can be built for less than $5.00 from the Pick-A-Brick wall from the picture on the front of the box. Buy a whole cup for $15.00 and you can make about half a dozen. If the additional cost was supporting a foundation for historic preservation or to feed children, I could see spending this for a "unique" piece of architecture and history. Unfortunately, I can own this for less ordering the parts from the LEGO online PAB. And no, the engraved "Sears Tower" doesn't make it worth $20.00. Save your money and make your own from the PAB wall. Todd

        <review>
            I saw this set and realized: The name changed to willis tower, yet it's still sears tower. I emailed the creator and thanks to me is is going to be changed... hopefully. youl see. I know this isn't a review but i don't want someone else to steal the credit.

        <review>
            A good set,if you overlook the price.
            Pros
            Cool looking,
            Sears Tower logo is not a sticker!,
            Can fit in the box.
            Cons
            Expensive,
            It is Extremely Fragile.
            Overall a 3/5

        <title>Very basic but very nice looking</title>
        <review>
            The Sears Tower, loosely based on the real deal, is very easy to build.
                The sleek black tower took maybe 8-10 minutes for me to build. I enjoyed the number of tiles for my collection and I also enjoyed the general appeal to this set. It really is something that you can display on a mantel or coffee table and have it fit nicely with almost every sort of room decor.
                It is sadly a bit expensive for my tastes given the number of pieces, but is made up by the number of tiles, look, and informative booklet. Lego did a great job when creating the Architecture set in general.
                A good buy if you're wanting to get into the architecture scene.

        <title>Only con: base</title>
        <review>
            I really love Architecture sets, especially the small ones, It's fun to read about the building/monument and then build it
            The only con with this set, and other towers, except the Dubai one, is the base wobles, the 2 pieces of the base plate doesn't stay on one plane, a minor con, really fun build
